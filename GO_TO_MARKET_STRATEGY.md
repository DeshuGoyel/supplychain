**Email Sequence (5-touch campaign):**

**Email 1 (Day 1): Problem-focused**
```
Subject: Your supply chain team is using 5+ tools

Hi [First Name],

Most companies like [Company Name] use Coupa/SAP for sourcing, 
Kinaxis for planning, FourKites for visibility, Tableau for analytics, 
and email for everything else.

That's 5 licenses, 5 dashboards, and way too much manual work.

We built something different: One supply chain platform that replaces 
3-5 of these tools for $24K/year vs $240K/year.

Worth a quick 15-min conversation?

---

## SECTION 8: RISK MITIGATION

### Market Risks

**Risk**: Supply chain leaders hesitant to change existing tools
**Mitigation**: Start with pilot programs, offer money-back guarantees, focus on integration rather than replacement

**Risk**: Economic downturn reduces software spending
**Mitigation**: Position as cost-saving solution, emphasize ROI and efficiency gains

**Risk**: Large competitors (SAP, Oracle) launch competing products
**Mitigation**: Focus on mid-market, faster innovation cycle, better UX and pricing

### Execution Risks

**Risk**: Technical issues during scaling
**Mitigation**: Robust testing, gradual rollout, customer success team

**Risk**: Sales team can't hit targets
**Mitigation**: Conservative targets, multiple customer acquisition channels, founder-led sales initially

**Risk**: Customer acquisition costs too high
**Mitigation**: Diversify channels, optimize conversion funnel, focus on organic growth

### Competitive Risks

**Risk**: New entrants with similar solutions
**Mitigation**: Strong brand building, customer lock-in through data, network effects

**Risk**: Incumbent ERP vendors add supply chain modules
**Mitigation**: Position as complementary rather than competing, deep integrations

---

## CONCLUSION

This go-to-market strategy leverages multiple acquisition channels to reach mid-market companies with fragmented supply chain operations. The phased approach minimizes risk while building momentum, and the focus on ROI and measurable results aligns with enterprise buying processes.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Strong product-market fit** demonstrated through early customer success
2. **Diversified acquisition channels** to reduce dependence on any single source
3. **Value-based selling** focused on ROI rather than features
4. **Rapid iteration** based on customer feedback and market response
5. **Strong unit economics** with LTV/CAC ratios supporting sustainable growth

**Next Steps:**
1. Finalize target customer list for cold email campaign
2. Set up LinkedIn Ads and Google Ads campaigns
3. Create content calendar and begin production
4. Apply to speak at 2-3 upcoming conferences
5. Begin outreach to potential partners (ERP vendors, consultants)

The strategy is designed to be executed lean initially, then scaled based on performance metrics and customer feedback.
